        <h2><u>Career Goals</u></h2>
        <pre>
    I really don't have any specific goals in mind;
    I have always wanted to work with computers.
    I was in IT in the Army and tried college for computer science,
    but I went into reserves and needed money,
    so I sadly dropped out.
    
    Now, the field is calling me again, and it has been for a while.
    I am fulfilling my younger selfs dream and pursuing this goal for us.
    Looking back, I have always wanted to work for IBM or Google by the end of it all.
