                <h2>Career Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    I really don't have any specific goals in mind; I have always wanted to work with computers.
                    I was in IT in the Army and tried college for computer science, but I went into reserves and 
                    needed money, so I sadly dropped out. Now, the field is calling me again, and it has been for
                    a while. I am fulfilling my younger self's dream and pursuing this goal for us.
