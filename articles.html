        <h1><u>Cable Tech Chronicles</u></h1>
        <p>
            I was tasked to write a blog about my field, but that does not do it justice.
            So, the best way for me to explain this job is to share a series of videos from
            a YouTube channel called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@cablemantrials6039"><em>Cableman Trials</em></a>. Please adjust the volume to your liking.

                        I can not possibly tell you <br>
                        how much a customer blamed myself <br>
                        or the company as the reason <br>
                        their equipment has been unplugged.

                        This has happened so much as <br>
                        well usually, with me when I <br>
                        try to explain the customer gets <br>
                        real defensive and yells up and <br>
                        down that they didn't do it.

                        Another common occurrence that happens to <br>
                        me and this video really nails <br>
                        it verbatim.

                        Now this one has really vamped <br>
                        up in occurrence since the summer <br>
                        has started and kids are out <br>
                        of school too many devices and <br>
                        not enough band-width to go around <br>
                        or that device has a bad NIC card.
